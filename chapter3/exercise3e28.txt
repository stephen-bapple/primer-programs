Exercise 3.29: List some of the drawbacks of using an array
instead of a vector.
    - The size of an array must be known at compile time.
        - Technically, many compilers implement variable length
          arrays, but programs that use them are not necessarily portable.
    - Size arrays degrade into pointers in many cases size information
      can be lost. This contributes to buffer overflows which are the 
      most common type of security hole when using C++.
    - Arrays are not easily resizeable like vectors.
    - They are, arguably, less intuitive to use than vectors.
