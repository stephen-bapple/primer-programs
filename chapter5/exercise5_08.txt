Exercise 5.8:
What is a "dangling else"? 
- A dangling else is an else that is associated with an inner if statement
  despite the programmer likely intending it to be paired with an outer
  if statement.

How are else clauses resolved in C++?
- else clauses are always paired with the immediately preceding if statement.
  This can be overriden by placing the nearest if inside the block of a
  preceding if making the else pair with that if instead.
