Exercise 4.08: Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND,
               logical OR, and equality operators.
    - The left operand is always evaluated first for the AND and OR operators,
      and the right operand will only be evaluated if the left operand was 
      true for AND or false for OR. For the equality operator,
      order of evaluation is undefined and left up to the compiler.

Exercise 4.09: Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:
    - const char *cp = "Hello World";
    - if (cp && *cp)

    - This if statement first checks if cp is the null pointer (as it has the
      value 0) and if cp is not the null ptr it checks if cp points to the null
      character (as '\0' has value 0). It evaluates to true iff cp is not the 
      null pointer and the character it points at is not the null character.
