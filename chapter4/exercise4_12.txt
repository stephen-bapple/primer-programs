Exercise 4.12: Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i != j < k means.
    - < has a higher precedence than !=, so j < k is evaluated first returning
      true or false. Because i is an int, the true|false is casted to int
      becoming 1|0 and then it is tested if i is equal to 1|0 depending on
      whether j was less than k.
      So the expression returns true if j < k and i == 1, or if j >= k
      and i == 0.
      The programmer should have been clearer about their intent as the meaning
      of this code is obtuse and may not mean anything at all. If it is correct
      the programmer should have written: 
          if (i == 1 && j < k || i == 0 && j >= k)
      as it avoids comparing a bool to an int and is more clear about what is
      being tested.
