Exercise 6.2: Indicate which of the following functions are in error and why.
Suggest how you might correct the problems:

(a):
int f() {
    string s;
    // ...
    return s;
}

This function is in error because the return type (int) does not match with
the returned value s (string). To fix it the return type should be changed
to string:

string f() {
    //...
}


(b):
f2(int i) { /* ... */}

This function is in error because it is missing a return type.
A return type should be added preceeding the function name, we'll use void
since the code snippet doesn't hint at any return value:

void f2(int i) { /* ... */ }


(c):
int calc(int v1, int v1) /* ... */ }

This function is in error because it is missing an opening curly brace and the
second parameter has the same name as the first. To fix it the opening brace
should be added and the second parameter changed to a different name:

int calc(int v1, int v2) { /* ... */ }


(d):
double square(double x) return x * x;

This function is in error because it is missing its curly braces.
Despite if/else while and for not strictly requiring block statements,
functions do. It can be fixed by adding the braces:
double square(double x) { return x * x; }
