# primer-programs
Solved exercises written for C++ Primer

This repository is purely for learning C++. 
It contains C++ programs written based on the the exercises in C++ Primer 5th edition by Stanley B Lippman, Josee Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo. 

Miscellaneous Info:   
It is organized into folders based on chapters. 
Some exercises were skipped, including ones not requiring programs and ones I felt were too trivial to write up.   
There are a few programs not based on exercises which were written purely to clarify language features for my own understanding.   
Some exercises are slightly altered in line with the errata found at: http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321714114/errata/9780321714114_errata_10-31-12.html
